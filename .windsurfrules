# CLAUDE.md

1. NO USELESS CONFIRMATORY FEEDBACK

2. NO EXPLAINING TO ME WHAT I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU

3. DO NOT TELL ME TO BUILD / RUN THE CODE _YOU DO THIS UNTIL YOU ARE DONE_

4. swrs/ IS A SUBMODULE. STOP CHANGING HOW WE USE IT.

5. AFTER YOU MAKE ANY CHANGE BUILD AND RUN THE CODE!!!

steamworks.ts is an attempt to combine steamworks-rs and napi-rs to build a slick, modern, strict, dev friendly typescript library for interacting with steamworks.

steamworks-rs is located as a submodule in swrs/ for reference.

src/ is where our own rust code goes.

run `npm run build` to build the project.

there is a test file in main.ts we can use to test things.

you can use `npx tsx main.ts` to run the test file.

As evidenced by steamworks.ts.win32-x64-msvc.code, we are able to build it.

I can confirm that main.ts also connects to steamworks, and the non-async stuff what we have is working.

Our priorities:
- 100% UGC feature coverage
- BASIC user information

Everything we might cover after that is fluff we'll think about later.

YOU MUST ASK ME FOR DOCUMENTATION ON EVERY NAPI-RS RELATED THING YOU DO.
